a Cmpe150 Project,
You can play the game through console.
Enjoy..

Welcome to Ultimate Battleships<br>
This is a game for 2 people, to be played on two 10x10 boards.<br>
There are 5 ships in the game:  Carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).<br>
First, the ships are placed. Ships can be placed on any unoccupied space on the board. The entire ship must be on board.<br>
Write the ship's name, followed by an x y coordinate, and the orientation (v for vertical or h for horizontal) to place the ship.<br>
If a player is placing a ship with horizontal orientation, they need to give the leftmost coordinate.<br>
If a player is placing a ship with vertical orientation, they need to give the uppermost coordinate.<br>
Player 1 places first, then Player 2 places. Afterwards, players take turns (starting from Player 1) to strike and sink enemy ships by guessing their location on the board.<br>
Guesses are again x y coordinates. Do not look at the board when it is the other player's turn.<br>
The last player to have an unsunk ship wins.<br>
Have fun!<br>
