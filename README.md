Welcome to Ultimate Battleships
This is a game for 2 people, to be played on two 10x10 boards.
There are 5 ships in the game:  Carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).
First, the ships are placed. Ships can be placed on any unoccupied space on the board. The entire ship must be on board.
Write the ship's name, followed by an x y coordinate, and the orientation (v for vertical or h for horizontal) to place the ship.
If a player is placing a ship with horizontal orientation, they need to give the leftmost coordinate.
If a player is placing a ship with vertical orientation, they need to give the uppermost coordinate.
Player 1 places first, then Player 2 places. Afterwards, players take turns (starting from Player 1) to strike and sink enemy ships by guessing their location on the board.
Guesses are again x y coordinates. Do not look at the board when it is the other player's turn.
The last player to have an unsunk ship wins.
Have fun!
